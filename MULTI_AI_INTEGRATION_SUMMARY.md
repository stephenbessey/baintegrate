# Multi-AI Integration Summary

## âœ… What's Already Implemented in Your Backend

Your BAIS backend already has **excellent multi-AI provider support**! Here's what I found:

### Supported AI Providers
- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)** - GPT-4, GPT-3.5 models
- **Google (Gemini)** - Gemini Pro and other Google AI models  
- **Anthropic (Claude)** - Claude 3 Sonnet and other Anthropic models
- **Ollama** - Local AI models for privacy and offline processing

### Backend Architecture
- **Universal AI Router** (`universal_ai_router.py`) - Routes requests to appropriate AI models
- **Provider Adapters** - Dedicated adapters for each AI provider:
  - `openai_service.py` - OpenAI ChatGPT integration
  - `gemini_service.py` - Google Gemini integration  
  - `claude_service.py` - Anthropic Claude integration
  - `ollama_service.js` - Ollama integration (Node.js)

### Smart Provider Selection
Your backend includes intelligent provider selection based on request type:
- **Transaction-heavy operations** â†’ Claude (for reliability)
- **Product search** â†’ GPT-4 (for reasoning)
- **Quick responses** â†’ Gemini (for speed)
- **Privacy-sensitive** â†’ Ollama (for local processing)

### API Support
The backend supports AI provider selection via API parameters:
```json
{
  "prompt": "Book a room for 2 guests",
  "businessType": "hotel", 
  "requestType": "book",
  "aiProvider": "openai"  // or "google", "anthropic", "ollama"
}
```
